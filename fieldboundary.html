											Soon, we’ll be able to identify every single crop field on Earth from the sky—from smallholder 
											plots to large commercial center-pivot circles. Detailed field boundary maps play a crucial role 
											in sustainable development planning. Huge efforts have gone into generating these maps, and more 
											institutions are now adopting them for a wide range of uses—from risk assessment and carbon 
											tracking to agricultural surveys and precision farming.</p>
										<p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;">
											Here, I present how field boundary data can help address food security issues in Zambia, where 
											the rapid expansion of medium-sized farms in the tropical savanna brings new opportunities—along 
											with complex environmental and socioeconomic challenges.

	<h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 1: How Could Individual Fields Be Identified from Satellite?</h2>
			<p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;"> We now have more openly archived, high spatial–temporal resolution imagery to cover the world.
				We have many AI variants that do computer vision tasks better, helping to identify objects in imagery.
				We have more powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to boost computation.
				We also have more labeled datasets, which make it easier to train accurate models.
				And we now have a growing ecosystem of open-source libraries and programming languages 
				that make geospatial analysis and deep learning more accessible than ever.

				As the algorithm (U-Net, in this case) continues training over multiple epochs, the model progressively learns 
				to recognize features of crop fields and can identify similar patterns (blue) in previously unseen imagery.

	<h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 2: Identify Crop Field Variation size in Zambia</h2>
	<p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;"> 
		We mapped every crop field in Zambia (D) and used examples of smallholder (A), medium-sized (B),
		 and large commercial farms (C) to illustrate the variation in field sizes. 
		 In several land-abundant countries, the typical ratio of small, medium, and 
		 large farms is expected to be around 50:40:10 (E), and we anticipate that the 
		 share of medium-sized farms in Zambia will continue to expand.
	</p>
	
	<span class="image main" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0;">
		<img src="images/sx_fb_img2_v2.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0;" />
		</span>
	

	<p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left; margin-top: 3.5em;"> 
		To better describe the spatial patterns of farming scales, we summarized the share 
		of area under small, medium, and large farms within 5×5 km resolution pixels and 
		identified the dominant farming scale for each pixel across the nation. This analysis 
		highlights the following patterns:
	</p>
	<ul style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
		<li>
			Prevalence of smallholder, shifting agriculture in the northern and northeastern parts of the country, including Northern, Muchinga, and Luapula provinces.
		</li>
		<li>
			Concentration of medium and large-scale farms in the Copperbelt and Central provinces, particularly near major highways and infrastructure corridors.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additional clusters of medium-sized farms in parts of the northwestern and southwestern regions, reflecting expansion of medium-scale agriculture.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<img src="images/sx_fb_img3.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0;" />
		</span>

	<p>*We used an empirical field size threshold of 2.1 hectares to separate small and medium 
		farms, and a threshold of 12 hectares to separate medium and large farms.</p>

	<h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 3: The Road Ahead — Yield Monitoring, Field Size Estimation, and Beyond</h2>
	<p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left; margin-top: 1.5em;"> 
		Having a field boundary map enables a wide range of policy and science-oriented applications. 
		For example, we can monitor changes in field size by district or any administrative unit (A), 
		guide remote sensing efforts to assess field-level NDVI and crop health (C), and explore potential 
		relationships between field size and land use stability (B and D). 
		Panel D shows the degree of overlap in field boundaries across years (2018–2024), 
		which we use as a proxy for land use stability. Our analysis reveals that, in Zambia, larger 
		fields tend to be more stable over time, while smaller fields—often associated with shifting 
		agriculture—exhibit less stability (B, where the y-axis represents stability).
