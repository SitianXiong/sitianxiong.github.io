        <p class="dropcap" style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
          Formed on August 17, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August 25 as a 
          Category 4 storm with wind speeds reaching 130 mph. It brought over 60 inches of rainfall 
          to parts of southeastern Texas, causing catastrophic flooding. The storm affected tens of 
          thousands of residents and resulted in an estimated $125 billion in damages.

        </p>

        <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
          As part of a remote sensing course project (Fall, 2017), this study uses Landsat imagery to examine 
          flood inundation around Houston. By applying the SAVI and NDWI vegetation indices, 
          we demonstrate how satellite data can support rapid damage assessment in the aftermath 
          of extreme weather events.

        <h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 1: Objectives and Data</h2>
        <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">We aimed to:</p>
        <ul style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
          <li>Examine land use and vegetation change before and after Hurricane Harvey.</li>
          <li>Assess the extent of flood-impacted areas and detect vegetation degradation using NDWI and SAVI indices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
          This project uses Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS Level 1 imagery (Path 25, Row 40) with 30-meter 
          resolution and bands 1–7, including false color composites (Bands 6, 5, 4), acquired 
          on April 6 (pre-Harvey) and September 29 (post-Harvey). The imagery was downloaded 
          from USGS Earth Explorer and GloVis. Although not ideal due to seasonal difference 
          and acquisition timing, these scenes were the closest cloud-free options available. 
          Additional data sources include ESRI county shapefiles, Google Earth, and NASA/USGS 
          Hurricane Harvey data portals, which were used indirectly to support interpretation 
          and improve contextual understanding. 
          
          <br><br>
          **It should be noted that this project was completed early in my studies, 
          under significant time pressure. The design and completeness 
          are not perfect, as we will explain throughout the later parts of this document.**
        </p>

        <hr class="major" />
        <h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 2: Methodology Overview</h2>
        <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
          Preprocessing steps included subsetting the imagery, masking with 
          county shapefiles, and applying reflectance correction using TerrSet. 
          Supervised classification was performed using both the Maximum Likelihood 
          Classification and the Neural Network (MLP) approach in TerrSet. 
          For classification schemes <strong>(Table 1)</strong>, we came 
          up with two through brainstorming, and they were implemented 
          separately by different group members. We followed a conventional 
          land cover schema (System 1) and used the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) 
          classifier to attempt to capture flood impact by tracking the 
          loss of other land uses and the increase in water. Another group 
          member used a second scheme (System 2) that incorporated a customized 
          class called “water-impacted vegetation,” defined as vegetation under 
          various inundation conditions, and applied the Maximum Likelihood 
          classifier. This second scheme may more directly capture the intermediate 
          forest–water mixture status. For the sake of time, the System 2 
          classification map was not included in the final project deliverable.

          <br><br>
          Error assessment follows a random sampling of 50 locations and confusion matrix. 
          We only had a chance to run the confusion matrix for the Maximum 
          Likelihood result. The MLP classification used training samples to 
          report accuracy, which likely overestimates accuracy by a considerable margin.

        </p>
        <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
          On top of Post-classification change detection, we also aplied vegetation 
          indices (Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI 
          and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, SAVI) to identify flood and vegetation 
          change. The NDWI detects surface water by contrasting green and 
          near-infrared bands, while the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) 
          enhances vegetation signals by minimizing soil background effects. 
          Together, they help highlight inundated and degraded areas 
          beyond what classification alone can capture.

          Classification accuracy for Maximum Likelihood is 84.62% on 
          the pre-Harvey map and 86% on the post-Harvey map. For MLP, 
          we only recorded a training accuracy of approximately 97%, 
          indicating a good fit to the training data. The overall 
          accuracy justifies the use of these maps to proceed with 
          subsequent area analysis.

        <ul style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">

          <li>
            Water area increased <span style="color: red;">▲</span>, 
            as indicated by both the MLP and Maximum Likelihood classification 
            results, with an estimated gain of about 2,189 ha (MLP) to 4,037 ha (Maximum Likelihood).
            The gains were mostly along the shoreline of Houston and Galveston Island, with additional 
            increases observed in Texas City and further inland near Missouri City and Pearland.
          </li>
            


          <li> 

            The Water-Impacted Vegetation class (System 2, Maximum Likelihood) increased <span style="color: red;">▲</span>
            by 11,710 ha, representing an 18.63% increase from its baseline of 62,847 ha. 
            It should be noted that the baseline is not zero, as this unique class was 
            already present in the pre-Harvey map—likely representing existing water–vegetation mixture zones.

          </li>

          <li>Built-up areas declined <span style="color: blue;">▼</span> in both MLP and Maximum Likehood Classification. Indicating 
            the impact to human livelihood. Two classifications had huge descripancy in the basedline of the Build-up,
            MLP estimated 67,681 ha, which almost two times of 35,845 ha in Maximum Likehood. Despite so, the loss rate are about 
            the same: 7.15% (MLP), 8.4% (Maximum Likelihood).
          </li>

          <li>
            Agricultural land also declined <span style="color: blue;">▼</span> in both the MLP 
            and Maximum Likelihood classifications. However, since the two systems differ 
            essentially in definition—pasture/grassland was grouped under agriculture in System 1 
            (MLP), but included with forest in System 2 (Maximum Likelihood)—the baselines are 
            too different for direct comparison. Still, both classifications consistently show a decrease.
          </li>

          <li>Vegetation degradation <span style="color: blue;">▼</span> 
            mostly occurred along rivers; SAVI and NDWI confirmed localized stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 4: Conclusion</h2>

          <p style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em;">
            Combining LULC classification with vegetation indices provides a practical 
            approach for post-disaster assessment. Our results reveal consistent 
            flood-related increases in water and inundated vegetation, along with 
            declines in built-up and agricultural areas. Vegetation stress detected 
            along rivers confirms localized ecological impact, highlighting the value 
            of remote sensing for disaster response.
          </p>


          <h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Part 5: Things to Improve</h2>

          <ul style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.3em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
            <li>The definitions of the two classification systems were reasonable but could be made more consistent—especially for classes like agriculture and pasture/grassland.</li>
            <li>From a design perspective, using red for "loss" and blue for "gain" may be more intuitive and visually effective.</li>
            <li>Accuracy assessment was incomplete; 50 sample points were not sufficient, and class-wise accuracy metrics should be reported.</li>
          </ul>
